### Exploring the neighborhoods of Toronto and New York city

#### Name: Debanjali Basu

## Introduction.

New york and Toronto are two well developed cities of the world. Since the geographical distance between this two cities are not too large,it is possible that both the cities share some similariries in terms of population, per-capita income,food culture etc. 
Now if an Asian business man, who lives in New york,wishes to open an Asian restaurant in Toronto, he would have to open the restaurant in a locality where he can expect a considerate amount of Asian population,to drive the demand. Therefore, in this project we would compare both the cities of New york and Toronto and then decide whether the businessman should open the restaurant in Toronto or in New york itself. 

## Data Description

For this project,we will datasets from the below mentoned sourses:

**1.Foursquares API:** from where we will scrape the accurate location data of the two cities.<br/>
**2.List of postal codes of Canada:**  from Wikipedia, where we obtain the info about boroughs and neighborhoods of Toronto. This dataset will be converted into pandas dataframe and used for exploring neighborhoods around Toronto.<br/>
**3.NYC geo location data from IBM** Similarly, we will use this JSON file to load NYC boroughs/neighborhoods dataset and explore it.
